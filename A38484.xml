            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Order of Confirmation, or laying on of hands upon Children baptized, and are able to render an account of their Faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Catechiſm following.</head>
            <p>TO the end that Confirmation may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to the more edifying of ſuch as ſhall receive it, (according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who teacheth that all things ſhould be done in the Church to the edification of the ſame) it is thought good that none here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be confirmed, but ſuch as can ſay in their mother-tongue the Articles of the Faith, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and can alſo anſwer to ſuch Queſtions of this ſhort Catechiſm, as the Biſhop (or ſuch as he ſhall appoint) ſhall by his diſcretion appoſe them in. And this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is moſt convenient to be obſerved, for divers conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe that when children come to the years of diſcretion, and have learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promiſed for them in Baptiſm, they may then themſelves with their own mouth, and with their own conſent, openly before the
<pb facs="tcp:57382:6"/> Church, ratifie and confirm the ſame, and alſo promiſe that by the grace of God they will evermore endeavour themſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve and keep ſuch things as they by their own mouth and confeſſion have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, foraſmuch as Confirmation is miniſtred to them that be baptiſed, that by impoſition of hands and prayer, they may receive ſtrength and defence againſt all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to ſin, and the aſſaults of the world and the Devil, it is moſt meet to be miniſtred when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their own fleſh, partly by the aſſaults of the world and the devil, they begin to be in danger to fall into ſundry kinds of ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the uſage of the Church in time paſt: whereby it was ordained that Confirmation ſhould be miniſtred to them that were of perfect age, that they being inſtructed in Chriſts Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould openly profeſs their own faith, and promiſe to be obedient unto the will of God.</p>
            <p>And that no man ſhall think that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment ſhall come to children by deferring of their Confirmation, he ſhall know for truth, that it is certain by Gods Word, that children being baptiſed, have all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their ſalvation, and be undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſaved.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> They did promiſe and vow three things in my name: Firſt, that I ſhould renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb facs="tcp:57382:7"/> that I ſhould believe all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian faith. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I ſhould keep Gods holy will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of my life.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A. I</hi> Believe in God the Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Maker of heaven and earth. And in Ieſus Chriſt his onely Son our Lord; which was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. He deſcended into Hell, the third day he roſe again from the dead.

I believe in the holy Ghoſt, the holy Catholick Church, the

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, I learn to believe in God the Father, who hath made me, and all the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in God the Son, who hath redeemed me, and all mankinde.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in God the holy Ghoſt, who ſanctifieth me, and all the elect people of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> You ſaid that your Godfathers and Godmothers did promiſe for you, that you ſhould keep Gods Commandments. Tell me how many there be?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which God ſpake in the 20 chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſaying, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</p>
            <p n="1">i. Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</p>
            <p n="2">ii. Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the
<pb facs="tcp:57382:8"/> earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou ſhall not bow down to them, nor worſhip them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto thouſands in them that love me, and keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p n="3">iii. Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Fame in vain.</p>
            <p n="4">iiii. Remember that thou keep holy the ſabbath day. Six days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou &amp; thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant &amp; thy maid-ſervant, thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, &amp; the ſtranger that is within thy gates. For in ſix days the Lord made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hallowed it.</p>
            <p n="5">v. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
            <p n="6">vi. Thou ſhalt do no murder.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:57382:8"/>vii. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</p>
            <p n="8">viii. Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
            <p n="9">ix. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy neighbour.</p>
            <p n="10">x. Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours houſe, thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his ſervant, nor his maid, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, nor any thing that is his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What doſt thou chiefly learn by theſe Commandments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I learn two things: My duty towards God, and my duty towards my neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is thy duty towards God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> My duty towards God is, to believe in him, to fear him, and to love him with all my heart, with all my minde, with all my ſoul, and with all my ſtrength. To worſhip him, to give him thanks, to put my whole truſt in him, to call upon him, to honour his holy Name, and his Word, and to ſerve him truly all the days of my life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is thy duty towards thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> My duty towards my neighbour is, to love him as my ſelf, &amp; to do to all men as I would they ſhould do unto me. To love, honor &amp; ſuccour my father &amp; mother. To honour &amp; obey the King, &amp; all that are put in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under him. To ſubmit my ſelf to all my
<pb facs="tcp:57382:9"/> Governors, Teachers, ſpiritual Paſtors and Maſters. To order my ſelf lowly and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all my betters. To hurt no body by word or déed. To be true &amp; juſt in all my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To bear no malice or hatred in my heart. To keep my hands from picking and ſtealing, and my tongue from evil ſpeaking, lying and ſlandering. To keep my body in temperance, ſoberneſs, and chaſtity. Not to covet nor deſire other mens goods, but to learn and labour truly to get mine own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to do my duty in that ſtate of life, unto the which it ſhall pleaſe God to call me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> My good childe, know this, that thou art not able to do theſe things of thy ſelf, nor to walk in the commandments of God, and to ſerve him without his ſpecial grace, which thou muſt learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer. Let me hear therefore if thou canſt ſay the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> OVr Father which art in heaven, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us. And lead us not into temptation: But deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What deſireſt thou of God in this Prayer?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57382:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I deſire my Lord God our heavenly Father, who is the giver of all goodneſs, to ſend his grace unto me, and to all people, that we may worſhip him, ſerve him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as we ought to do. And I pray unto God that he will ſend us all things that be needful, both for our ſouls &amp; bodies, and that he will be merciful unto us, &amp; forgive us our ſins, &amp; that it will pleaſe him to ſave &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us in all dangers ghoſtly and bodily, and that he will kéep us from all ſin &amp; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and from our ghoſtly enemy, &amp; from everlaſting death. And this I truſt he will do of his mercy and goodneſs, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore I ſay, Amen, So be it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A death unto ſin, and a new birth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſs: for being by nature born in ſin, and the children of wrath, we are hereby made the children of grace.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Repentance, whereby they forſake ſin: and Faith, whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes of God made to them in that Sacrament.</p>
            <p>

            <p>

            <p>

               <p>NOw you are come (children) in the feare of God, in obedience to the Church, and to the edification of your ſouls, to learn that form of Doctrine (which you are to <hi>obey from the heart</hi>) in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Church-Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the things that you ſhall learn from this Catechiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I learn, Firſt, how I became a Chriſtian by the bleſſed Ordinance of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, in the four firſt queſtions.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Being a Chriſtian, I learn what I ought to believe for my ſalvation, out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, that compleat ſummary of our Faith.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That we <hi>are members of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 5.30. <hi>We are joyned to him,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15, 17. <hi>Live in him,</hi> Eph. 4.4. Rom. 8.11. As <hi>branches of him the vine,</hi> John 15.5. <hi>Wives to him our husband,</hi> Epheſ. 5. <hi>Living ſtones</hi> upon him the foundation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Or, the firſt benefit is, that I am made a member of Chriſt, from whom the body fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplyeth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What is it to be a true member of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It's to be united to him by one ſpirit,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57382:23"/> to live in him by his grace, to be guided by him and his power: <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body, ſo is Chriſt. For by one ſpirit we are all baptiſed into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>It's true;</hi> If the ſpirit of him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. I am the vine <hi>(ſaith Chriſt)</hi> ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame beareth much fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>To be the members of Chriſt, is to receive from him as from our head, life, ſenſe, and motion. What condition were you in before you were a member of Chriſt? and what would have become of you if you had not been thus made a member of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We ſhould have been <hi>ſtrangers from the life of God,</hi> the life of grace derived to us from God in Chriſt, from whom we might have received <hi>grace for grace,</hi> Epheſ. 4, 10.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>Indeed as we had withdrawn our ſelves from the authority of God by our diſobedience, ſo we are withdrawn from the gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God by ſin, whereby all the faculties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57382:23"/> of our ſouls are corrupted, the imaginations of our hearts are evill, the frame of our nature is depraved, and we are dead in ſin, untill an heavenly life from God in Chriſt, in whom he is well pleaſed, enliveneth us; and that heavenly ſpirit which he hath received without meaſure quicken us according to the meaſure of every part. But are all they true members of Chriſt that are baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. Some are onely members of Chriſt outwardly: <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. Heb. 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others are members of Chriſt inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that have inwardly that grace from Chriſt their head which they profeſſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular,</hi> 1 Cor. 12 17.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What is the ſecond benefit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>That we are children of God,</hi> John 1.12. See <hi>what manner of love is this the Father hath ſhewed us, that we who are by nature children of wrath, ſhould be called the ſons of God!</hi> 1 John 3.1. Epheſ 1.5. Gal. 4.4, 5, 6. Heb. 2.10, 11, 13. 1. <hi>We are called by his name,</hi> 1 John 3.1. 2 Tim. 2.19. 2. <hi>We are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57382:24"/> admitted to his family,</hi> Gal. 6.10. He feeds, provides for, pitieth, protecteth, corrects, inſtructs and rewards us.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What would you have been, if you had neglected being baptized, if you had not entred into the Chriſtian profeſſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Oh! I ſhould then have wiſhed I had never been born; or being born, to die: then I had been <hi>a child of wrath even as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. I had been one of thoſe whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>curſed children,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. <hi>a ſon of perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it to be a child of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be a child of God, is, 1. To be framed after Gods image, <hi>in righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe.</hi> 2. It is by favour to be adopted for Gods child.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſt.</hi> To be a child of God, is to be begotten anew by the immortal ſeed of the Word, and bear Gods Image in holineſſe, endeavouring in all things to do their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.26— To be removed from the family wherein we lived by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the family of heaven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3, 19. where God is our Father, Chriſt is our elder Brother, the Saints are our co-heirs, the Angels are our fellow-ſervants; to he free from all our former relations: <hi>If Chriſt hath made you free, then are you free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57382:24"/> — and to be inveſted in all the rights and priviledges of the ſons of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Do you know what are the priviledges of being ſons of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. A child of God is free from the guilt of ſin: <hi>There is now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who live not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1. 2. He is under the care of God. 3. He is an heir of the promiſe of God for this life, and that which is to come. 4. He hath a <hi>new name which no man knoweth but he that hath it,</hi> Rev. 2.17. 5. He hath <hi>the ſpirit of God, whereby he cryeth Abba, Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What is your duty now you are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We ought, 1. to admire Gods love. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the children of God!</hi> 1 John 2.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould imitate him, as obedient children; <hi>not faſhioning your ſelves according to your former luſts in your ignorance; but as he who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We ought to reſt in his good will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, knowing that it is our gracious Father, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ought to rely upon him, as a child doth upon his father.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57382:25"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the third benefit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That we are hereby inheritors of the kingdome of heaven, not onely that we are ſons, <hi>but heirs of God, and co-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17, 29. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4. Luke 12 32. <hi>Fear not, little children, it's your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good will to give you a kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>If you had not thus been entred into a Chriſtian profeſſion, what had become of you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Being without Chriſt, <hi>aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, we ſhould have been ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and being without God in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How do we inherit the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. Not by birth, for ſo his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. the <hi>brightneſſe of his image, and the expreſſe character of his perſon,</hi> hath he appointed heir of all things, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But by gift; <hi>The gift of God is eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are we aſſured of this gift?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We are aſſured of it, 1. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which will never fail: <hi>Fear not little flock, it is your fathers will to give you the kingdome,</hi> Luke 12.32. John 17.24. Heb. 4.13. 2 Theſ. 1.7. <hi>And faithful is he that hath promiſed.</hi> 2. In the price paid, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>A. <hi>They did promiſe and vow three things in my name:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That they promiſed to inſtruct us in the ſin and danger of yielding to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and doing the works of the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of mankind, the Devil.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHat is the firſt Article of your Belief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why do you ſay, <hi>I</hi>
                  </hi> believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To ſignifie that every one muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his own faith, and not by anothers: <hi>Examine YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R SELVES, whether you be in the faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. <hi>Know ye not YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R OWN SELVES,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prove YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R OWN SELVES, that you may have rejoycing in your ſelves, and not in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The Church firſt diſcovers to us the true faith, and afterwards we put our own ſeal to it,</hi> that it is true. <hi>As if Chriſt ſhould ask every one of us in particular, as he did the blind man reſtored to his ſight,</hi> Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.35, 38. <hi>we are taught every one of us to anſwer as he did,</hi> Lord I believe, <hi>As if the Son of God did promiſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57382:31"/> to every one of them which are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name, what he promiſed to one of the multitude, whoſe ſon had a dumb ſpirit,</hi> If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth: <hi>each one for himſelf returneth this anſwer,</hi> Lord, I believe, help mine unbelief, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.17, 23, 24. I live, (<hi>ſaith St.</hi> Paul) yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. <hi>But what do you mean when you ſay,</hi> I do <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When I ſay, <hi>I do believe;</hi> 1. I ſay, I do underſtand this truth, <hi>that God is, &amp;c.</hi> 2. I ſay, I give my aſſent to it as revealed of God; by his Son outwardly, and his Spirit inwardly. 3. I ſay, I confeſs this truth thus embraced before the world.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Therefore when you ſay you believe this and the other Articles of faith, you mean that you aſſent to them as an infallible truth revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, (who by reaſon of his infinite knowledge cannot be deceaved, and by reaſon of his infinite holineſs cannot deceive) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto us in the writings of the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, immediately inſpired and acted by the Holy Ghoſt, out of whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57382:32"/> this brief ſum of neceſſary points of faith was firſt collected. I ſay, you mean that your faith came by the ear</hi> hearing <hi>of theſe words opened in the Church, and that the ear conveyed them to your mind</hi> in all wiſdome and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual underſtanding: <hi>the mind conveyeth the truth ſo underſtood to the heart, which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, receaveth and embraceth it; and then</hi> out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh: <hi>and if now</hi> you confeſs with your mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in your heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, you ſhall be ſaved. <hi>Do you think you muſt make confeſſion of your faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. In reſpect of Gods glory, who hath commanded it. 2. In regard of our ſelves, who ſhall be rewarded for it. 3. In regard of others, who ſhall be confirmed and edified by it; we muſt make profeſſion of our faith before men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in his own glory, and in his Fathers, and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Be ready always (<hi>ſaith St.</hi> Peter) to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>What do you mean when you ſay you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>in God?</hi>
                  </hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean, 1. that there is a God: for <hi>he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>Gods</hi> atteſtation, <hi>is the</hi> ground <hi>of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith; his</hi> being <hi>is the ground of his</hi> atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation: <hi>What is the ſecond thing you mean when you ſay,</hi> I believe <hi>in God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean, that I believe him the onely true God, holy, omnipotent, all-wiſe, all-ſufficient, juſt, merciful, and good; who is of himſelf, and by whom all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>How do you know that there is ſuch a God infinitely holy?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know it, 1. by his works ſhewing; for by the greatneſs and beauty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proportionably the beauty of them is ſeen, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. We ſee ſome things here below have a beginning; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe a God above who hath no beginning: all things that are made, are made by another; for nothing we ſee makes it ſelf: therefore we believe a God, <hi>never</hi> made, but <hi>ever</hi> of himſelf, <hi>by whom all things were made.</hi> Yea, when I ſee creatures work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without reaſon, according to reaſon, in order to their ſeveral ends in their ſeveral places, I believe a <hi>God over all,</hi> who guides theſe creatures by that <hi>eternal counſel of his will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 5. I know there is a God by my own Conſcience, which comforts me when I do well, and torments me when I do ill with the thoughts of God, who is not far from every one of us; <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have a being,</hi> Act. 17. whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſought after, if by any means they might feel after him, and find him: for they knew <hi>we are all his off-ſpring.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean that I believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty, Maker of all things viſible and inviſible; who <hi>made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is,</hi> Exod. 22.11.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe in God aright, 1 When I embrace his teſtimony with full aſſurance of Faith. 2.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. When he gives him that filial fear, honour and reverence that is due unto him. <hi>A ſon honoureth his father, and a ſervant his maſter: if then I be a father, where is mine honour, ſaith the Lord of hoſts?</hi> Mal. 8.6.

               <p n="2">2. When he relies upon him as a father: <hi>Your Father knoweth how to give you good things,</hi> Mat. 7.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He believes God a Father, when he can with patience bear all Gods dealings with him. <hi>We have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Father of ſpirits, and live?</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, that <hi>they chaſtened us for their own pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.9, 10.

                  <hi>A.</hi> A man may diſcern that he hath true faith in God as <hi>Almighty,</hi> 1.

               <p>Q. <hi>It's true, this is a ſigne a man owns the Soveraignty of God over us: But how ſhall a man know he truly believes the infinite power of God in himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. When he fears him: <hi>I will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn you whom you muſt fear; fear him which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell: I ſay unto you, Fear him,</hi> Jam. 4.12. Luk. 12.5.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>What ſhould your faith <hi>in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth,</hi> work in you?</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean when you ſay,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him who <hi>was conceived of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I am verily perſwaded that he who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was now in the fulneſs of time conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and <hi>born of the Virgin Mary: For as much as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame,</hi> Heb. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why was he made fleſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we who are ſinful fleſh, might be ſaved by him, he becoming ſin for us, and we the righteouſneſs of God in him; <hi>therefore it behoved him to be like his brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.17. And <hi>the Mediator between God and man,</hi> muſt be <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57382:47"/> 2.5. <hi>Since by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.31.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Our Nature ſinned, our Nature muſt ſuffer: but becauſe our Nature which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, could not ſatisfie the infinite juſtice of God, it was joyned to the Divine Nature; ſo that our Saviour, who was of the fathers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, was</hi> God over all, bleſſed for ever. <hi>How is Chriſt ſaid to be <hi>conceaved by the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Father willed his Incarnation, the Son conſented to it, and the Spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it. Chriſt being not capable of redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our Nature but in our Nature, he had a body prepared for him by the holy Ghoſt, who ſeparated the ſame body from ſin, and united it to his Divine Nature, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.34, 35. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. &amp; 4.15.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I hope that <hi>the Father hath made him ſin for me who knew no ſin, that I who knew ſin might become the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I hope that as his Nature was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparated from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo our Nature will be preſented by him to the Father without ſpot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I learn firſt thankfulneſs, in that the kindneſs and love of God towards man appeared, in not taking the Nature of the fallen Angels, but <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16. Tit. 3 4. Luk. 1.78.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſter.</hi> So then you aſſent unto this as a moſt neceſſary and certain truth, <hi>That the onely begotten Son of God, very God of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God, was conceived and born, and ſo made man, taking to himſelf the Humane Nature, conſiſting of a ſoul and body, and joyning it to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57382:48"/> the Divine Nature in the unity of his perſon.</hi> And you are fully aſſured, <hi>That our Saviour thus made fleſh, was really and truly conceived in the womb of a Virgin by the ſingular, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inviſible, and immediate operation of the holy Ghoſt; whereby a Virgin was beyond the Law of Nature enabled to conceive, and that which was conceived in her, was originally and compleatly holy.</hi> And thus you profeſs to <hi>believe in Ieſus Chriſt, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I learn humility from him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal with God, yet humbled himſelf to be like us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſter.</hi> So then you aſſent to this as a certain truth, <hi>That there was a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man known by the name of the</hi> Virgin Mary; <hi>a pure and unſpotted Virgin, who did by the immediate operation of the holy Ghoſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within her womb the onely begotten Son of God; and after the natural time of other women, brought him forth as her firſt-born: whereby the Saviour of the world was born of a woman under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, without any Original corruption, that he might deliver us from the guilt and ſtain of ſin: Born of that Virgin which was of the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>that he might ſit upon his throne, and rule for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> And on this manner you believe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>born of the Virgin</hi> Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How will the knowledge of theſe things work in the heart of him whom God will ſave?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It will bring him to a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own ſtate, to grieve for ſin,

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>I believe the reſurrection of the dead:</hi> Which is another priviledge that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the members of the Catholick Church, and to them that are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by the reſurrection of the body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I do believe that this body of mine, and the bodies of all men, though they be diſſolved by death into duſt and aſhes, yet ſhall be again raiſed out of the duſt of death, and rejoyned to our immortal ſouls; that ſo we may receive according to our deeds done in the fleſh, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</p>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. <hi>Our Catechiſm is an excellent ſum of Religion, ſhewing the Rule of Faith in the Belief, the Rule of Devotion in the Lords Prayer and Sacraments, and the Rule of Life in the Commandments of God; which you ſay</hi>
                  </hi> your Godfathers and Godmothers did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for you in your Baptiſm, that you

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which be they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which God ſpake in the <hi>20</hi> chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſaying, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</p>
               <p n="1">i. Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</p>
               <p n="2">ii. Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto thouſands in them that love me, and keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p n="3">iii. Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Fame in vain.</p>
               <p n="4">iiii. Remember that thou keep holy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57382:67"/> the ſabbath day. Six days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou &amp; thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant &amp; thy maid-ſervant, thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, &amp; the ſtranger that is within thy gates. For in ſix days the Lord made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hallowed it.</p>
               <p n="5">v. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
               <p n="6">vi. Thou ſhalt do no murder.</p>
               <p n="7">vii. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</p>
               <p n="8">viii. Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
               <p n="9">ix. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To keep Gods holy will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of our life, <hi>Luk. <hi>1.75.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. <hi>Our Catechiſm is an excellent ſum of Religion, ſhewing the Rule of Faith in the Belief, the Rule of Devotion in the Lords Prayer and Sacraments, and the Rule of Life in the Commandments of God; which you ſay</hi>
                  </hi> your Godfathers and Godmothers did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for you in your Baptiſm, that you
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57382:72"/> ſhould keep. Tell me how many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments there be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ten; <hi>which be called <hi>ten words, Deut.</hi> 4.3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which be they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which God ſpake in the <hi>20</hi> chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſaying, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</p>
               <p n="1">i. Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</p>
               <p n="2">ii. Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto thouſands in them that love me, and keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p n="3">iii. Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Fame in vain.</p>
               <p n="4">iiii. Remember that thou keep holy
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57382:73"/> the ſabbath day. Six days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou ſhalt do no manner of work, thou &amp; thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant &amp; thy maid-ſervant, thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, &amp; the ſtranger that is within thy gates. For in ſix days the Lord made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hallowed it.</p>
               <p n="5">v. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
               <p n="6">vi. Thou ſhalt do no murder.</p>
               <p n="7">vii. Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</p>
               <p n="8">viii. Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
               <p n="9">ix. Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</p>
               <p n="10">x. Thou ſhalt not covet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe, thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his ſervant, nor his maid, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, nor any thing that is his.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. The firſt ſin is Negligence; which they are guilty of, that</p>

               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57382:89"/>
               <p>A. The firſt is taken from the equity of it; God allowing us ſix days of ſeven for our own affairs, and reſerving but one for himſelf: <hi>Six days thou ſhalt labour and do all thy work.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. The ſecond reaſon of keeping the Sabbath-day holy, is, Gods ſpecial proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that day: <hi>The ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. The bleſſing God hath put upon that day; not onely in ſanctifying it to be a day for his ſervice, but in ordaining it to be a means of bleſſing to us in our ſanctifying it: <hi>wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>What do you learn from thoſe words?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. Becauſe as we by nature owe our God a debt of obedience, ſo as ſinners we owe him a debt of puniſhment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 14.</p>

               <p n="1">1. One of tryal, to prove us in faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as God doth, <hi>Job</hi> 23.10. and we count it all joy when we fall into ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another of ſeduction by Satan, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, deſtroy, and undo us; and againſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57382:124"/> this we pray, <hi>Lead us not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it to be led into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To be led into it, is to be overcome, ſo as that ſin prevails, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 26.41. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.1.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is God ſaid to lead into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. God leads a man into temptation, 1. when in any tryal he doth forſake a man. 2. When he doth withdraw his grace from him. 3. When he doth ſuffer him to fall, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. 4. When he hardens his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.3. 5. and gives him wholly up into Satans power, and the full ſway of his own corrupt heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26. When we are ſo entangled with ſin, that we cannot finde our way out.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>What is it to be DELIVERED from evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To deliver, is, 1. to ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 2. or protect us from, 3. or to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue us from evil.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by <hi>the evil?</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I mean,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Evil One,</hi> Satan, the author of all evil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The evil of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The evil after ſin, Death.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:57382:124"/>4. The evil of my own heart, and of the world, that leads to ſin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19, 21, 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it then that you deſire of God in this Petition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We deſire that ſin may not onely be pardoned, but deſtroyed; and that we may be freed from all tryals and temptations to ſin, ſo far as it ſtands with Gods pleaſure; and always from the evil thereof, that we faint not under them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. and undergo the evil of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many things do you deſire in this Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We deſire,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſeeing we cannot be tempted but by the will of God, and we cannot reſiſt but by his power, he would never leave us nor forſake us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he would tie up Satan, that he may not have his will over us, and teach us to walk wiſely and circumſpectly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8, 11. that he would preſerve us from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that is in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.15. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the power of our corruption that is within us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We deſire that he would never take away his holy Spirit ſo, as that we be left in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57382:125"/> the hand of our own counſels, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our own luſts, ſo as that we cannot eſcape.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We deſire that in temptations (if he ſee good to prove us) he would always ſtand by us with his grace to keep us from falling, and to give us an holy uſe of our tryals.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We deſire that if at any time our God ſhould leave us to our weakneſs, he would graciouſly raiſe us up again, with increaſe of ſpiritual ſtrength and courage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We deſire that he would mortifie our luſts and corruptions, and ſupport us by his grace againſt them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We deſire that the Lord would ſtir us up to watch and pray, leſt we enter into temptation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We deſire that our God would put an end to all tryals, and to theſe days of tryals; and that he would give us, 1. hope, 2. patience, 3. comfort, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.17. and a good iſſue out of all tryals, that we may neither preſume nor deſpair, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We deſire that our God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and perfect the work of his grace in us, enabling us to every good work; and in ſtead of temptations to evil, he would

               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Lead us not into temptation: <hi>Pity thy poor ſervants in the midſt of their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and give us ſpiritual ſtrength, holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, a watchful ſpirit, the whole armor of God, thy protection, the guard of Angels, and the conduct of thy holy Spirit, to be our ſecurity in the day of danger.

                  <hi>How many Sacraments hath Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Two onely, as generally neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Which are thoſe two?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Circumciſion and the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under the Law. 1. By Baptiſm we are admitted into the Church. 2. By the Lords Supper we are nouriſhed, preſerved, and grown up in Chriſt after we are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>What do you mean when you ſay, that theſe two Sacraments are <hi>generally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation?</hi>

               <p>A. We mean that all ought to receive theſe Sacraments that will attain Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſter.</hi> This is not ſo to be underſtood, as if God could not ſave without them: but that they are the means inſtrumental, and ordinary ſeals by which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to aſſure and convey Chriſts merits unto us, and commandeth us this way to receive them: ſo that wilfully to neglect them, or to want them when they may be had, is to neglect Gods Ordinance, and to diſobey Gods command.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the uſes of Sacraments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. They are uſeful,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſeparate Gods houſhold from ſtrangers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are Bonds of Obedience, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of mutual Charity, Provocations to Piety, Preſervatives againſt ſin, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of the benefit of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are viſible marks by which God gives notice of his approach; and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to impart the ſaving grace of Chriſt to all that are capable thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are conditional means, which God requires to be obſerved of them unto whom he imparts grace: which grace a worthy Receiver partakes of, by his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57382:129"/> going along with the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by this word</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>We mean an outward viſible ſigne, of an inward and ſpiritual grace, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt himſelf, as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is contained in a Sacrament?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. The whole obedience, merit, death and paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the benefits that flow thence are,</p>

               <p n="3">3. Sanctification; for by the power of his Spirit we die to ſin, and live unto righteouſneſs.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>How come theſe outward and viſible ſignes which we ſee, to ſignifie the inward and inviſible grace which we believe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Becauſe Chriſt hath ordained it: he ſaid, and it was done, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who hath power to ordain Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. God onely, who can confer grace on worthy receivers, and can puniſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receivers.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>For what end were the Sacraments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. To be a means to receive grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be pledges to aſſure us of grace received.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What do you mean by that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We mean three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Sacraments repreſent to us, and ſet before our eyes what Chriſt hath done for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They convey that ſo laid before us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſouls, in ſo much grace and favour as is needful for us; as, Pardon of ſin, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, acceptation, and ſtrength to do what he requires.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Sacraments are a pawn left us by God in the hands of the Miniſter, to give acquieſcence and ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the graces promiſed ſhall be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57382:130"/> ſurely performed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11.</p>
               <p>Miniſter. <hi>Our God not content with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral offer of the promiſes, out of his meer mercy hath thought fit to ſeal them to every particular believer, having a regard thereby to their infirmity; that by faith they may apply thoſe things they ſee, to ſuch things as are not ſeen: he hath given us ſeals to the word of the covenant of grace, to inſtruct, aſſure and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs us of our part in Chriſt and his benefits, and to bind us all in thankful obedience to him, and in love to his ſaints. Do you know how the Sacraments are eſpecial means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The Sacraments are ſpecial means to confirm our Faith, becauſe in them Chriſt is in ſpecial manner repreſented and offered to all, and received by thoſe that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate worthily.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Who are lawfully called to adminiſter the Sacraments?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. By the Covenant of grace in Chriſt, which is ſealed by Baptiſm, whereby upon faith in Chriſt, we are reſtored to Gods grace and favour: for <hi>we are hereby made

               <p>Q. <hi>What is required of perſons to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. It is not onely to be touched with the ſence of ſin, to be grieved for it, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it, or to reſolve againſt it; but really, ſincerely, and actually, to leave and forſake it: ſo that though weakly we fall into it, yet wilfully we commit it not, nor obſtinately continue in it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What uſe do you make of your Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. In all our fears and doubts we look back to our Baptiſm, and the promiſes of God ſealed therein, which we believe ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to our comfort.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, they do perform them by their Sureties, who promiſe and vow them both <hi>in their names;</hi> which when they come to age, themſelves are bound to perform.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How can they promiſe and vow for the Children?</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>Did you ever read in the Scripture that Children entred into any Covenant?</hi>

               <head>SUNDAY XLVIII. Of the Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>WHat is the other Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>For the continual remembrance of the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt, and the benefits we receive thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What do you learn from hence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I learn, firſt, that Chriſt died for me, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his death is a Sacrifice; <hi>he made his ſoul a ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> Heb. 9.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Sacrament was ordained to be a continual remembrance of that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me. So oft as we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> Luk. 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.14.</p>
               <p>Miniſter. <hi>Yes, here we have Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57382:136"/> before our eyes, repreſented lively before us as upon the croſs: hereby we remember Chriſts death, and the benefits we receive thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the benefits we receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The firſt, is to remove guilt: <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt purgeth us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is to remove the ſting of it: <hi>there is now no condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8.1.</p>
               <p>The third, is to weaken the power of it: <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt purgeth our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14.</p>
               <p>The fourth, is reconciliation: <hi>for we are by his blood reconciled unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, is eternal redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 17.14.</p>
               <p>The ſixth, is liberty to enter into heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What is the outward part of the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath commanded to be received,</hi> Mat. 26.17. Mark 14. by all people.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the inward part or thing ſignified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>The body and blood of Chriſt, which are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lords Supper,</hi> Luk. 22.17. Mat. 26.28.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:57382:137"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How do we <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> receive Chriſts body and blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By faith: <hi>The Cup which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> who is preſent there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Believe, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> Auguſtine, and thou haſt eaten. <hi>How many manner of ways may Chriſt be ſaid to be preſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. He is preſent as God in all places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is preſent as Man on the right-hand of God, <hi>making interceſſion for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He is preſent by his grace in the hearts of believers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is preſent by a ſpecial bleſſing, <hi>where-ever two or three are gathered together in his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He is preſent effectually in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>So then you believe that Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament by his ſpecial preſence, as God; that he is preſent in the hearts of true Communicants, ſpiritually; and that he is in the Elements, repreſentatively. Who are to communicate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. All true Chriſtians: <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> Mark 14.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are the benefits whereof we are partakers by the Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57382:137"/>
               <p>A. <hi>The ſtrengthning and refreſhing of our ſouls by the body and blood of Chriſt, as our bodies are by the bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>As the body is ſtrengthned by bread, ſo the heart is eſtabliſhed, and the ſoul is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by grace in the Sacrament of Chriſts body: as wine cheers the heart, ſo the blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament rejoyceth the conſcience with an holy comfort. Come, O ye that are weak, to this Sacrament, and it ſhall ſtrengthen you: Come, ye that are weary and heavy laden, and it ſhall refreſh and eaſe you. But what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them that come to the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To examine themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What are they to examine themſelves in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. They are to examine themſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>they truly repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it truly to repent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. To have a true ſenſe of a real ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our former ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to lead a new life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond thing we ought to examine our ſelves in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. A true and lively faith in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:57382:138"/>
               <p>Q 1. <hi>You muſt have</hi> faith, 2. <hi>a</hi> lively <hi>faith,</hi> 3. <hi>and that in</hi> Gods mercy, 4. <hi>which is ours</hi> through Chriſt. <hi>What is ſaving faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Faith is ſuch a perſwaſion in heart, or belief of the truth of the Goſpel, or that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a perſon to manifeſt or make it known by fruits of love to God and men: or, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith is a grace or habit infuſed into the ſoul by the holy Ghoſt, whereby we are enabled to believe not onely that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is offered to us, but alſo take and receive him as our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the third thing you ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is to examine whether we have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our faith a <hi>thankful remembrance of Chriſts death</hi> in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What doth this thankful remembrance imply?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It implies, firſt, an humble ſenſe of Gods mercy: ſecondly, an hearty and real expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that ſence in word and deed, by our words and by our lives, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46, 47.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth thing you are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves in before a Communion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Whether we be in charity with all men.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:57382:138"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>When you have ſet your hearts right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, you muſt try how they ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man,</hi> Mat 5.23. <hi>For as this Sacrament ſeals the Communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A. Firſt, in giving cheerfully to them that want, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in forgiving heartily them that have treſpaſſed againſt us; without which our ſins are retained, our pardon not ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our prayers not accepted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A. For conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Conſcience, of what?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That there is no power but what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if we ſhould, as many have done, reſiſt the powers?</hi>

               <p>Q <hi>But what if our Governours are wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We are to obey not onely the gentle, but the froward: and they cannot be more wicked then they were in <hi>Moſes, Daniel,</hi> our Saviour, the Apoſtles, and the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans time; yet they obeyed the worſt, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cruelleſt, gave their due to the moſt unjuſt, <hi>(to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars)</hi> and ordained Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations <hi>for,</hi> and obedience <hi>unto</hi> all.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What, to thoſe that command what God forbids, or forbid what God commands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, even to thoſe by way of <hi>cheerful obedience</hi> in things lawful, or of <hi>patient ſubmiſſion</hi> in things unlawful; either doing willingly what they enjoyn, or ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently what they inflict.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if your ſuperiours force your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. They cannot force my conſcience; for I may think what I pleaſe: but they may
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57382:139"/> reſtrain my practice; for I muſt not do what I pleaſe. I am to be in all caſes very fearful of my own opinion, when it croſſeth the reſolutions of a whole Kingdome: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I have faith, I will have it to my ſelf; in thoſe things I have already attained, I will conform; in other things I will ſtay peaceably and quietly until the Lord reveal it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Yes, but it is hard to be undone for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Government undoeth no man; the Law is innocent, and declares onely the Kings Conſcience, who muſt have that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to govern according to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we would have to obey. If our Opinions be conſcience, we are not good Chriſtians if we do not cheerfully and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly ſuffer for them; if not, we are not honeſt men if we do not leave them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What think you of thoſe that repine and complain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I think they charge God fooliſhly, who takes ſpecial notice of Murmurers and complainers; of thoſe <hi>that curſe their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in their thoughts,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if there were an opportunity to alter the Government, and redreſs grievances?</hi>

               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:57382:140"/>
               <p>A. I will always think upon that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: If the ſpirit of the Ruler be ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, move not out of thy place.</hi> And that, <hi>My ſon, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them who are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to change: for who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> I will poſſeſs my ſoul in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and pray for thoſe that <hi>are over me, that under them I may lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>But are not we of this Nation bound by our Covenant to oppoſe the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>How muſt you behave your ſelf in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I muſt think God is there in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner by his preſence and aſſiſtance, though but two or three meet together in his Name; and I muſt <hi>take heed to my ſelf when I go into the houſe of God,</hi> Eccleſ 5 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>What geſture muſt you uſe there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">A. 1. When I pray, I muſt <hi>fall down and kneel before the Lord my Maker,</hi> as my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and all good men have done in all Ages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When I confeſs my faith in the Belief or Goſpel, I muſt ſtand up, as not aſhamed to believe with the heart, and make confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the mouth to Gods glory, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification and confirmation of others, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57382:141"/> the ſalvation of my own ſoul, as I do when I exalt the Name of God in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> I bow to his Perſon; to whom I let all men, even thoſe that deny his Godhead, thereby ſee that (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When I hear, I do it reverently, not as to the word of man, but as to the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When I receive the Sacrament, I do it with all humility, which I ſhew the world for their inſtruction, by receiving that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy from the hands of my God upon my knees.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Dare you put on your Hat there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. No, becauſe of the Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Why do you reverence the Church more then any other place, and one part of the Church more then another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Knowing God is preſent every where, I expreſs my reverence to him in that place where I am in an eſpecial manner drawing near to him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How ought you to behave your ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Miniſters of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I ſhould attend to their Doctrine,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57382:142"/> live their Sermons, follow their examples, pray for their infirmities, honour their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and callings <hi>for their works ſake,</hi> and pay them the tenths, and other duties appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God and Man for their maintenance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What if you do not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If I neglect them, I neglect God; if I rob them, I rob God alſo.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But what if they are weak?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I muſt eye the ſtrength of God in their weakneſs; and look neither on <hi>Paul planting,</hi> nor <hi>Apollo watering,</hi> but on <hi>God that giveth the increaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But what if your Miniſter be wicked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. I am to pity his infirmities, which are his own; to honour his Calling, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Doctrine, which are of God; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remembring that we have the <hi>Goſpel-treaſure in earthen veſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What think you of his habit, as his Gown, Surplice and Tippit? can you hear him in them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It's no more to me what Habit he prayeth or preacheth in, then it is to him what Habit I hear him in: all our Cloaths ſhould be decent and comely: but the Word of God doth not depend upon the Cloaths of men; his Garments can no more hinder his Preaching, then mine do my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:57382:142"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>But do you think it neceſſary to pray ſo much, and ſo often as you do now?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We whoſe dependance upon God is ſo great, whoſe ſins are ſo many, whoſe wants are ſo hourly, whoſe mercies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſo every moment, cannot too often make our requeſts known unto God by prayer and ſupplication with thankſgiving. Prayer is the life of our Religion: we hear that we may believe, we believe that we may have communion with God in prayer, and we pray that we may be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>May we joyn in a form of Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We may as well joyn in words preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Church, as in thoſe invented by a private Miniſter; for we are equally tied to the one as well as the other: beſides that all good men, both before and ſince Chriſts time, worſhipping one God in one Faith, have uſed one form of words conſtantly, <hi>Deut</hi> 6. <hi>ult.

               </p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>You pray not by the Spirit when you joyn in a dead form?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. No form of good words is dead to me, if my heart be not dead: The work of the Spirit in prayer is not to invent a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57382:143"/> of expreſſion, but to keep up the heart to good expreſſions: then I pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not when I ſpeak many words, which I can do by nature; but when I raiſe my heart to go along wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h good words, which I can do onely by grace.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why were you marked with the Croſs in Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To ſhew that I, as well as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, am not aſhamed to own Chriſt and his Croſs, which Heathens, Turks and Jews deride; that mark ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Popiſh Superſtition, but my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reſolution.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are there not many things in our Church that are in the Church of</hi> Rome?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; and we have thrown away the Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt we ſhould be a corrupted Church; not the good uſages thereof, leſt we ſhould be no Church: if we caſt off every thing that <hi>Rome</hi> hath, we muſt throw away our Bibles: what was Primitive in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we retain; what is meerly Popiſh, we reject.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Sure there are many things that are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A There is nothing owned here, but what was practiſed by all the Chriſtians in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57382:143"/> the world in every Age of it. If theſe things are Antichriſtian, there hath been no ſuch thing as Chriſtianity in the world: for thus Chriſtians lived in all Ages, and thus they died.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>Why do you ſay the ſame things over ſo often?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To quicken our hearts: we have the ſame wants and ſins, and we uſe the ſame words, as our Saviour did thoſe words, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. thrice in one hour.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Is not our Common-prayer-book in the Maſs-book?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, ſome of it is, as there is ſome of the Bible in it, and both taken out of the old Lyturgies of the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>Do you not hear the Apocrypha?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A.

               <head>SUNDAY LII. A brief account of all the Faſts and Feſtivals obſerved by the Church of <hi>England</hi> throughout the year.</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>YOu have given a fair account of ſome things in the Common-prayer; can you tell me one thing more, why we keep Faſts and Feſtivals?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Our two great duties being to pray to, and praiſe God, we fit our ſelves by Faſts and Humiliations for the one, and by Feſtival Solemnities for the other.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But why do we obſerve days not enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. If conſtant ſervice of God, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over our ſelves is enjoyned, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time is left to our liberty: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we muſt obſerve Faſts, as mindful of our ſins; ſometimes we muſt keep Feſtivals, as mindful of Gods mercies: and if at any time, at what time better then on that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Publick Authority?

               </p>
               <p>A. Yes: we can ſay they are the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, the Witneſſes of ancient truth, Motives to ſerious Devotion, Laſting Records on earth, and ſhadows of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>A.

               <p>Q <hi>Proceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The next is <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> whoſe doubt intimates our frailty, as his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrengtheneth our faith: on whoſe day we meditate on his confeſſion, <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> we imitate his faithfulneſs, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where he died <hi>anno Chriſt.</hi> 25. and learn his faith and patience.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Go on.</hi>

               <p>A. After this we celebrate <hi>St. Pauls ſtrange Converſion,</hi> the Apoſtle of us Gentiles: learning the ſinfulneſs of Nature

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. As a Memorial of our comfort in the Angels care of us, and our duty in imitating them: whereon we contemplate their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, meditate on the good they do us, and all mankinde, in ſoul and body: we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their tuition of us, we obſerve their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and ſervice.</p>

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To celebrate the Communion of Saints in heaven and on earth, joyned to Chriſt by faith, and to one another by love; and communicating in each others joy and ſorrow, and following each others good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all vertuous and godly living, until we all come <hi>to the meaſure of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Have you any more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes: 1. <hi>St. Lukes-day,</hi> the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Phyſitian of ſoul and body, who cured our infidelity by publiſhing the Goſpel as Chriſts <hi>Amanuenſis;</hi> and ſtrengthened our
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57382:157"/> Faith by writing the <hi>Acts</hi> as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wherein he died in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anatolia, anno</hi> 74. on whoſe day we pray God to heal our ſouls with his whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>St. Simon and Iudes day,</hi> two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Nature and Grace, called by Chriſt to promote Unanimity, and commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us to promote Love. St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Catholick Epiſtle we read to amend our lives: his ſincere and plain dealing we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to direct our ſteps: his diligence to promote the common ſalvation by writing and travelling, we conſider, to follow him: his refuſal of King <hi>Abyarus</hi> his gifts, becauſe he had left his own goods for Chriſt, and would take anothers for himſelf, we lay to heart, to teach us moderation in the uſe of this world: his death by the Prieſts of that Country, we lament, but learn by it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faith. St. <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> Zeal, we admire and imitate: his travels to <hi>Aegypt, Libya, Perſia, Cyrene,</hi> and ſome ſay to <hi>Britain,</hi> we thank God for: his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion when ſecond Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 120, we Regiſter; Learning with him, not to look on thoſe things <hi>which are ſeen, which are temporal; but on thoſe things which are not ſeen, which are eternal.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>Why do we honour theſe Saints, and not Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>A. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>If</hi> Timotheus <hi>had not been, we had not had ſo much ſweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; but if</hi> Phryny, <hi>which was his Maſter, had not been, we had not had</hi> Timotheus: ſo if theſe Saints had not been, we had wanted good examples; but if our Saviour had not been, we had not had theſe Saints. We honour him in them, and them in him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why do we faſt the <hi>Eves</hi> of the Holy-days?</hi>

               <p>A. To prepare our ſelves for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of them.</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>Why do you not faſt on all Holy-day-Eves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Not on the Circumciſion, becauſe it is an Octave, and the Octaves never had their Vigils: not on the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> becauſe it was a Faſt-day it ſelf: not on St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> Eves, becauſe there are no Faſts between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide:</hi> not St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> becauſe the Angels entred not to their Joys through ſufferings: not on St. <hi>Lukes,</hi> becauſe there was a ſolemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val obſerved in our Church at the Eve of it.</p>

            <head>A Pattern of Dayly Devotion, drawn by the Life of the moſt Reverend and Pious Son and Father of this Church.</head>
            <p>INſtead of Prayers, which uſe to be at the end of Books of this nature, we have thought fit to ſet before you the Pattern of dayly Devotion, out of the Life of the moſt reverend and eminent perſon that ever this Church bred: whereby all men may ſee how they may have and keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in the uſe of the wholſom Prayers and Directions of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and withal, how they may keep up their ſouls in a ſuitable holy frame at thoſe Prayers, which may <hi>honour</hi> God, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> them, adorn our Religion, convince gainſayers, and keep a happy correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between us and heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As ſoon as you awake, be ſure you have ſome choice Pſalms and Portions of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57382:161"/> Scripture to pitch your firſt thoughts upon, together with ſome meditation of ſleep, of the night, Gods preſervation towards you: to which end you ſhould have the ſeven pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Pſalms; and indeed all the Pſalms, as they had them in the Primitive Church, by heart: and you ſhould enlarge your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on the Lords moſt comprehenſive Prayer, obſerving each word, with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and comforts contained in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suffer no worldly buſineſs to poſſeſs your thoughts, till you have conſidered the temper of your ſoul within; your opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of doing good, and your temptations to evil from without: your carriage for the time paſt, and your reſolution for the time to come; and wrapped up thoſe thoughts in ſome Scripture-ſentences, Ejaculations and Meditations: and then drawing ſome holy Conſiderations from every thing you do, and keeping your ſoul in a conſtant courſe of contemplation, till in an humble ſenſe of your ſin againſt, and dependance upon God, you kneel and ſay, <hi>O holy, bleſſed, and glorious Trinity, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and one God, have mercy upon me a miſerable ſinner. <hi>Lord, I know not what to pray for as I ought: O let thy Spirit help my infirmity, and enable me to offer up a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57382:161"/> ſacrifice to thee by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </hi> And then by the help of that Spirit, raiſe up your ſoul to go along with the Confeſſion at the beginning of the Common-prayer, and that at the Communion; which you may read, and enlarge your heart upon, according to your own condition, running over particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in your thoughts, while you read gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Having opened your heart to God, if you can, go to Church, or any other place where you may receive the Abſolution from the Miniſter, who hath power to declare the will of God concerning poor penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo as whoſe ſins he declares pardoned upon their repentance and faith, they are pardoned; and whoſe ſins he declares not pardoned upon their impenitence and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, they are not pardoned. Hear, if you can, the Commiſſioned Embaſſador of God, opening his good will concerning a penitent ſinner. If that cannot be, look upon the three gracious Abſolutions, 1. in the beginning of the Common-prayer, the 2. at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the 3. at the Viſitation of the ſick, and apply them to your broken heart, and believing ſoul, and then go on in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-prayer, the Pſalms and Leſſons of the day, warming your heart by the one, and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57382:162"/> inſtructing it by the other; being ſure always to apply every period as near as you can to your own occaſions, and enlarge upon every Petition of the Prayers, and upon every Verſe of the Pſalms in your mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing your thoughts upon them by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a method, which you may make uſe of to quicken you at any time. After the Morning-prayer, you may uſe ſome Collects, either for thoſe ſpecial graces you want, or againſt the ſpecial ſins you are ſenſible of, or for the ſpecial mercies you have received, or for others, ſuperiours, your friends, or enemies; and to that end he reduceth the Collects to a method, that you may chuſe them out for your own occaſion, concluding always with that, <hi>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When he is ready, he hath a peculiar meditation for every accident that occurs to him; and there can be no opportunity of hearing, praying, or diſcourſing, that he waves or neglects. At the beginning and end of every affair that is likely to take up his thoughts, he armeth his ſoul by a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reflexion and Ejaculation, ordinary or extraordinary, as the nature of the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:57382:162"/>5. Before Dinner, where-ever he is, he retires for half an hour to reading, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prayer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. At Dinner he hath a Chapter read, and diſcourſed of before him by as able men as any are in the Land, ſuch as uſe his Table.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He hath his Diary for every remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble particular that falls in word or action from himſelf or others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. After the hour he allots to diſcourſe, and the four hours he allows buſineſs, wherein he keeps up his private and pious conſiderations, agreeable to events, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to the evening Office, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms as he did the morning, adding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of his Diary of that days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque.</p>
            <p n="9">9 As he examineth the account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at the cloſe of it, ſo of every week, every moneth, and every year at the end of them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The benefit he found by this courſe of devotion, was, That there happened no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within or without him for which he was not prepared by an heavenly remedy.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Repentance being the great buſineſs of his life, upon all Faſt-days, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, directed by the Church, or private, ſet apart by himſelf, 1. He ſurveyed his life,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57382:163"/> and heart, noting down the particulars of each, with all circumſtances. 2. He wrought himſelf to a due ſenſe of his vile and dangerous condition, until he was affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a true and hearty ſorrow for, and eſtabliſhed with a ſtrong reſolution againſt his ſinful life or actions. 3. Applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God by faith in Chriſt, by ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prayer. 4. Offering up himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unto God, with a promiſe of new life by Gods gracious aſſiſtance and Spirit. 5 Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on thoſe duties wherein he hath been moſt defective, and mortifying thoſe ſins to which moſt enclined. 6. Always making and keeping his peace with his own heart, and with all men.</p>
            <p n="12">12. He choſe out ſeveral Collects in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, reſerving to himſelf a liberty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries upon the ſeven hours of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as 1. at 3 a clock in the morning; 2. at 6; 3. at 9; 4. at 2; 5. at 3 in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; 6. at 6; 7 at 9, or bed-time.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He hath a large Volume of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Obſervations upon the Lyturgie, the Bible, the Sacraments; together with the publike Occurrences: whch teacheth an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and ſteady Soul to reduce every thing it readeth, ſeeth or heareth, to its own purpoſe and occaſions.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:57382:163"/>14. The laſt things, the Theological gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Cardinal Vertues, the Sins that are neareſt that againſt the holy Ghoſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deadly ſins, the ſixteen fruits of the Spirit, the twenty Policies of Satan, the ten Commandments, the twelve Articles of our Faith, have taken up ſo much of his time, that he hath ſix Volumes of his own obſervations upon them. <hi>Go thou and do likewiſe, that thou maiſt attain his honour and reſpect, his virtues and exactneſs, his peace with God and his own conſcience and his Name, which ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance.</hi>
